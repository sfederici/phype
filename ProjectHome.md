## What is phype? ##
Phype is not a pipe. Phype is a project formed in connection with the course _Design of Virtual Machines for Object Oriented Languages_ at [DAIMI](http://daimi.au.dk). Phype is a Javascript-based virtual machine that will allow you to run PHP code directly in your browser with `<script>`-tags.

The project deadline has now been exceeded, and the project is officially done. Work may continue, so keep posted.
